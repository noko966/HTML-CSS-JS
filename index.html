            When you do a render in a 3D software like Blender, it usually
            looks better than the model you import into Three.js, no matter
            how hard you try to get the exact same lighting and colors. This
            is because of the technique used while making the render.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Ray Tracing consists of casting multiple rays toward each pixel
            of the render. These rays start with the geometry we are
            rendering. Next, they test the direction of each light in the
            scene to see which part of the geometry is illuminated as well
            as to test whether the directions of the light bouncing off the
            geometry are colliding with other objects in the scene. Then,
            for each of these collisions, more rays are being cast as they
            bounce off other objects. And it goes on and on like this
            multiple times. All of the information collected by these
            collisions is then computed to define the final color of that
            pixel.
